# Editors

As programmers, we spend most of our time editing plain-text files. It's worth
investing time learning an editor that fits your needs.

How do you learn a new editor? You force yourself to use that editor for a
while, even if it temporarily hampers your productivity. It'll pay off soon
enough (two weeks is enough to learn the basics).

We are going to teach you Vim, but we encourage you to experiment with other
editors. It's a very personal choice, and people have [strong
opinions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war).

We can't teach you how to use a powerful editor in 50 minutes, so we're going
to focus on teaching you the basics, showing you some of the more advanced
functionality, and giving you the resources to master the tool. We'll teach you
lessons in the context of Vim, but most ideas will translate to any other
powerful editor you use (and if they don't, then you probably shouldn't use
that editor!).

The editor learning curves graph is a myth. Learning the basics of a powerful
editor is quite easy (even though it might take years to master).

Which editors are popular today? See this [Stack Overflow
survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#development-environments-and-tools)
(there may be some bias because Stack Overflow users may not be representative
of programmers as a whole).

## Command-line Editors

Even if you eventually settle on using a GUI editor, it's worth learning a
command-line editor for easily editing files on remote machines.
