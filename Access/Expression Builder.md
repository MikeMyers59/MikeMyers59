# The Expressio Builder

**Quick Info**: When creating an expression that includes a function, a complex formula that may use multiple elements called arguments, Quick Info provides additional information for how to construct the function and use the arguments. For example, if the function you are using includes optional arguments then those arguments will be shown in square brackets, enabling you to quickly determine which pieces need to be supplied.  

**AutoComplete**: As you type your field names, or the name of another item such as a function, Access will instantly show you all items that fit the spelling profile. And, when you use AutoComplete, by pressing the Tab key to complete the selected item, Access will automatically insert additional syntax that may be needed.  

**ToolTips**: Display next to the selected item in the AutoComplete list and provide a description to help you find exactly what you are looking for so you can get it right the first time.
