1. In Word, point to Macro on the Tools menu, and then click Visual Basic Editor.   
2. In the Project Explorer, double-click ThisDocument. (If the Project Explorer isn't already open in the Visual Basic Editor, click the Project Explorer toolbar button to open it.) 
3. In the Code window, click Document in the Object box.   
4. In the Procedure box, click each event to insert procedure templates into the Code window.   
5. Type or paste the following statements to the procedures to create the following subroutines: On the File menu, click Save.
