Why are the color Palette different between applications?

### Add a transparent area to a picture

#### Using MS365 Publisher:
If the picture does not have a transparent area, you can make one. You can create a transparent area in most pictures.  
1.	Select the picture that you want to create transparent areas in.  
2.	Click Picture Tools: Format > Recolor > Set Transparent Color.  
3.	In the picture, click the color you want to make transparent.  

**Notes**: 
•	The Set Transparent Color option is available for bitmap pictures that don't already have transparency information. It's also available for some, but not all, clip art.  
•	To create a transparent area in an animated GIF, use an animated GIF editing program, and then insert the file again.  



## Outlook Archive Files

| PST | Personal File Storage |  
| OST | Outlook File Storage |  
| OAB | Offline Address Book |  
**NOTE**: To avoid file corruption, do not let the file size of any PST exceed 1 gigabyte (GB). In addition, it is recommended that you back up PSTs regularly to a removable storage device such as an NMCI external hard drive, a CD, or a DVD.
