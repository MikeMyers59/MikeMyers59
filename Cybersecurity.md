#### What is the cloud?
Cloud computing is essentially the offering of an application or service that is offered over numerous devices, or locations. This can be provided over three different types of Cloud Computing. They are Private, Hybrid, and Public Cloud. Private would be based solely on the vendor's facility, while Hybrid would augment this location with some public facilities. Public Cloud would be provided totally on the outside by a vendor like the service provided by Amazon, or Microsoft.  Cloud computing is being used in our everyday life, such as banking, Email, media streaming, and Ecommerce (Amazon).

#### Here are some of the most popular Cloud Service types with examples:
- SaaS – Software as a Service – Office 365, Adobe, Facebook
- PaaS – Platform as a Service – Amazon, Online Games, Apple, Google Drive
- BaaS – Backup as a Service – Amazon, Microsoft products, Apple

#### What risks are there for cloud use at home?
Cloud computing brought home users a way to use their data across multiple devices and made it available on the go.  The inherent problems that exist for that level of availability are many.  You may not think your data is at that great of risk, but you must remember, that someone is always looking to get easy score of data and use it maliciously.   Here are some of the types of attacks that actors use:

| Attack Type | Description | 
| --- | --- |  
| Phishing | used to steal sensitive information (credit card data, usernames, and passwords, etc.) from users. The attackers pretend to be a trustworthy entity (usually by copying the look and feel of a big brand) to trick the victims into revealing their confidential data. |  
| Exploit Kits | Exploit kits (EKs) are computer programs designed to find flaws, weaknesses or mistakes in software apps and use them to gain access into a system or a network. |  
| Password Sniffing | This is a tactic used by cyber criminals to harvest passwords. They do this through monitoring and snooping in on network traffic to retrieve password data. |  

These are just a few of the many attacks that can be used to capture your data.  So remember to encrypt, use complex passwords, use Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) when available and be vigilant.  Know what your clicking on or responding to and don't give your information out.
