# Data Types

The obscure Decimal data type does exist, but you canâ€™t declare an item as being of that data type. Instead, you have to declare the item as a Variant data type with a subtype of Decimal. For example, Dim X as Variant defines a variable X as a variant; X = CDec(value) stores value in X as a Decimal data type.
