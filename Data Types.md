# Data Types

The obscure Decimal data type does exist, but you canâ€™t declare an item as being of that data type. Instead, you have to declare the item as a Variant data type with a subtype of Decimal. For example, Dim X as Variant defines a variable X as a variant; X = CDec(value) stores value in X as a Decimal data type.  

# Date-Time

[MonthCalendar by Stephen Lebans](http://www.lebans.com/monthcalendar.htm) is a database containing a Class that wraps the Microsoft Month Calendar Common Control in an easy to use interface. This is a completely API generated Month Calendar derived directly from the Common Control DLL. There are no distribution or versioning issues as there are if you use the ActiveX Month Calendar control.
