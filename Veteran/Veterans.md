#### Priority Group 1
- Veterans with VA-rated service-connected disabilities that are 50% or more disabling
- Veterans determined by VA to be unemployable due to service-connected conditions

### Locations
| Center | Location | Notes |  
| -- | -- | -- |  
| American Lake VMAC | 9600 Veterans Drive Tacoma, WA 98493 | 59.1 miles via a toll bridge |   
| Harborview VMAC | 1660 South Columbian Way Seattle, WA 98108 | 30.7 Miles by Ferry 1; 46.0 miles by Ferry 2; 81.4 miles by car with no Ferry (Toll Bridge) |   
| Puget Sound Health Care System (PSHCS) |  |  |  
| Silverdale CBOC |  |  |  

**Possible alternative**: Ferry to Seattle (parking in Bainbridge), walk to Federal Building and ride with DAV to Harborview.

Access to the VMACs is a monetary penalty to those that do not live near them! Travel, waiting and ferry timing cause Veterans to lose too many hours at work for even a single quick appointment.

### Get your Health Records
My HealtheVet offers you three options for reviewing and sharing information from your VA health record.  
VA Blue Button Report: Customize your request for information by choosing the date range and types of information you want to view, such as lab results and progress notes. This option gives you access to current and historical information, self-entered information and DoD Military Service information.   
VA Health Summary: Get a summary of your VA health information, such as allergies, health conditions, medications, laboratory tests, and more, to share with community (non-VA) providers or other applications. Note: You are not able to choose the information included in the summary.  
VA Medical Images and Reports: Access your Radiology studies such as X-rays, MRIs or CT scans. You can download and share these images and reports with your providers, including non-VA providers.  
Get Started:  
1. Log into My HealtheVet with your Premium account.
2. On the home page, select 
3. Select the type of report that you need.
4. Follow the steps on the next page.
5. Get your data by selecting your preferences to view, download or print.
  
You can still request medical record information from your VA facility Release of Information Office.  

### Request a Medication Refill
To receive a refill by your VA prescriber, you must request a refill using one of the ways below:  
- **By phone**: Most VA Pharmacies have automated telephone refill lines. The phone number of your local VA Pharmacy is on your prescription label. To order refills by phone, you need your prescription number (shown as Rx number on the prescription) and Social Security Number. You can also check VA medical facility telephone numbers online.
- **By mail**: VA Pharmacy provides a refill request form with each prescription filled. To refill by mail, please complete the request form and mail it to your VA pharmacy at the address listed on paperwork that arrives with your prescription.
- **Online**: Veterans can use My HealtheVet or the VA Rx Refill mobile application to request prescription refills online. Both tools require Veterans have a personal My HealtheVet Advanced or Premium account. The VA Rx Refill mobile app requires a DS Logon. You can view your prescription history and track the delivery status of your package online. Prescriptions that need special handling (such as refrigeration) are mailed from your local medical center and cannot be tracked on My HealtheVet at this time. To receive your prescription on time, request your refill at least ten days before you run out. VA will not process your refill until seven to ten days before you're scheduled to run out.
  
**NOTE**: Some prescriptions may not be refillable by VA Pharmacy. Examples of prescriptions the pharmacy cannot REFILL are:
- Prescriptions from VA providers that you fill or obtain outside the VA;
- Some controlled substances such as certain pain medications, which cannot be refilled; and
- Short term antibiotics.
Contact your VA healthcare team if you have any questions/concerns or need more of your medications.
- Please do not wait until you are out or almost out of medicine to order your refills. Take your medications as your doctor says. Keep your medication list up to date and share it with your healthcare team.
- If you would like to cancel a prescription you no longer use, please contact your healthcare team. The phone numbers for VA medical centers is the same as the pharmacy phone number of your prescription label.  
  
When a prescription no longer has refills, and you need to remain on the medication, you must request a prescription renewal. You should contact your VHA provider as soon as possible to have a new prescription ordered. The best way to do this is to check the number of refills remaining on each medication every time you request a refill and before you visit your doctor.
  
### Secure Messaging (using MyHealtheVet)
If you are a Veteran who gets care at a VA facility, you may be able to use Secure Messaging. Secure Messaging is an online way you can communicate with your health care team. When you use Secure Messaging to speak with a member of your health care team you will see the following message:  
**Attention**  
-	This message system should be only used for non-urgent, non-critical communication!  
-	Please direct any urgent or critical concerns to your provider's office via telephone or in-person.  

What does this mean for you? Understanding the difference between non-urgent and urgent gives you the know-how for safely seeking information or care. It can also ensure that you receive the right care at the right time. Secure messaging is not a hot line for health problems. It should not be used if you need immediate care. Secure messaging should not be used as an extension of the emergency room. Secure messaging is for routine questions you may have for members of your health care team.
#### Non-Urgent Messages  
Non-urgent are routine messages that do not require immediate attention. In most cases, these are messages that can wait to be answered. This is similar to a routine visit to your primary care clinic. Some examples of a non-urgent concerns include:  
- Asking about an appointment
- Lab-test results
- Renewing your medications
- Message to the clinic staff
- Asking about your medications
- Question to your health care team
      
#### Urgent Messages  
[You can always reach out to the Veterans Crisis Line](https://www.veteranscrisisline.net/)
Urgent is something serious, which may need immediate medical attention. In most cases, urgent health concerns are considered serious and require emergency care. If not treated immediately they could result in disability or death. Urgent or emergency health concerns should not be addressed through Secure Messaging. Some examples of urgent medical concerns include:  
- Bleeding
- Fever
- Broken bone	
- Chest pain
- Infection
- Spinal cord or back injury
- Trouble breathing
- Feeling suicidal

If you are away from home and cannot wait until you see your health care provider for treatment, you need to go to the closest VA Clinic, Urgent Care or emergency room. If you have trouble breathing or have chest pain it is recommended you call 911 for immediate help. Do not use Secure Messaging in place of seeking medical care.  

### Travel Benefit  
The Beneficiary Travel program provides eligible Veterans and other beneficiaries mileage reimbursement, common carrier (plane, train, bus, taxi, light rail etc.), or when medically indicated, "special mode" (ambulance, wheelchair van) transport for travel to and from VA health care, or VA authorized non-VA health care for which the Veteran is eligible. More information on eligibility at: https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vtp/beneficiary_travel.asp  
Basically, what this means is that VA will pay for your transportation costs to a VA facility if you are eligible. Check the link above to learn more, but most Veterans who are eligible have a service connected rating of 30% or higher or are being treated for a service connected injury.
If you have applied for travel reimbursement and are waiting to receive payments after the claim has been processed, please contact your local Beneficiary Travel Program Office or call 1-877-222-VETS (8387) for assistance. The funds are typically direct deposited into the individual’s account within 7 to 10 business days.
