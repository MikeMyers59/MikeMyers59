| /|Arithmetic operator|Divides the left by the right operand | Y |  
| +|Arithmetic operator|Adds the operands | Y |  
| %=|Assignment operator|Divides the left by the right operand and assigns the remainder to the left operand | Y |  
| *=|Assignment operator|Multiplies the operands and assigns the result to the left operand | Y |  
| /=|Assignment operator|Divides the left by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand | Y |  
| +=|Assignment operator|Adds together the operands and assigns the result to the left operand | Y |  
| =|Assignment operator|Assigns the value of the right operand to the left operand | Y |  
| -=|Assignment operator|Subtracts the right from left operand and assigns the result to the left operand | Y |  
| !=|Comparison operator|Evaluates to true if the operands are not equal | Y |  
| <|Comparison operator|Evaluates to true if the left operand is less than the right operand | Y |  
| <=|Comparison operator|Evaluates to true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand | Y |  
| ==|Comparison operator|Evaluates to true if the operands are equal | Y |  
| >|Comparison operator|Evaluates to true if the left operand is greater than the right operand | Y |  
| >=|Comparison operator|Evaluates to true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand | Y |  
| !|Logical operator|Evaluates to true if the operand is false and to false if the operand is true| Y |   
| &&|Logical operator|Evaluates to true when both operands are true| Y |   
| |||Logical operator|Evaluates to true when either operand is true| Y |
