# Modules

Here’s how the modules should be organized:

-	Public/Private/Constant declarations in alphabetical order by type  
-	Public/Private Procedure Declarations in alphabetical order [Declares]  
-	Functions in alphabetical order  
- Subs in in alphabetical order  
-	Events in event order and then in object order  

Standard Module: A page that contains VBA code that’s accessible to all objects in the database. A standard module always exists in the Modules group in the Navigation pane. A standard module contains procedures you can run from anywhere in your database. 

Class: A page of VBA code that’s attached to every form and report you create. You can also create a class module that appears in the Navigation pane.
