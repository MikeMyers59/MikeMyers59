# Reference Libraries in VBE

## Setting References to Object Libraries  

To open the References dialog box and choose your object libraries, follow these steps (in the Visual Basic Editor Program window): 

1. Choose Tools➪References from the Visual Basic Editor menu bar. The References dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-8, opens.  
2. To set a reference to an object library, select its check box. Some object libraries are already selected (checked), as shown in Figure 2-8. The selected object libraries shown in Figure 2-8 are typical and are a good starting point for any Access VBA programming.  
3. When all the object libraries you need are selected, click OK to close the dialog box.

To find out what objects are available to VBA (and you) at the moment — and get help with them all — you need to use the Object Browser.
