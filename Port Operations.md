# Port Operations

## Port Forwarding
In many scenarios you will run into software that listens to specific ports in the machine. When this happens in your local machine you can type `localhost:PORT` or `127.0.0.1:PORT`, but what do you do with a remote server that does not have its ports directly available through the network/internet?.

This is called _port forwarding_ and it
comes in two flavors: Local Port Forwarding and Remote Port Forwarding (see the pictures for more details, credit of the pictures from [this StackOverflow post](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/115897/whats-ssh-port-forwarding-and-whats-the-difference-between-ssh-local-and-remot)).

The most common scenario is local port forwarding, where a service in the remote machine listens in a port and you want to link a port in your local machine to forward to the remote port. For example, if we execute  `jupyter notebook` in the remote server that listens to the port `8888`. Thus, to forward that to the local port `9999`, we would do `ssh -L 9999:localhost:8888 foobar@remote_server` and then navigate to `locahost:9999` in our local machine.
