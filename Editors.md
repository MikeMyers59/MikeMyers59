# Editors

One of the most crucial tools for software development is the editor. Editors are where you write your code and sometimes where you will run your code.  
Developers rely on editors for a few additional reasons:    
- **Debugging** Discovering bugs and errors by stepping through code, line by line. Some editors have debugging capabilities, or can be customized and added for specific programming languages.    
- **Syntax highlighting** Adds colors and text formatting to code, makes it easier to read. Most editors allow customized syntax highlighting.  
- **Extensions and Integrations** Additions that are specialized for developers, by developers, for access to additional tools that aren't built into the base editor. For example, many developers also need a way to document their code and explain how it works and will install a spell check extension to check for typos. Most of these additions are intended for use within a specific editor, and most editors come with a way to search for available extensions.  
- **Customization** Most editors are extremely customizable, and each developer will have their own unique development environment that suits their needs. Many also allow developers to create their own extensions.
