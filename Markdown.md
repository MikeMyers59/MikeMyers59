#  Markdown

## Center an Image in MD
Here are thre ways to get that image centered!
```html
<p align="center">  <img src=<ImageURL> /></p>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src=<ImageURL> /></div>
<span style="display:block;text-align:center">![Your Image Alt Text] <ImageURL>)</span>
```

## Use doctoc to create your Table of Contents  
- [doctoc Install](https://github.com/thlorenz/doctoc)

Adding toc to all files in a directory and sub directories  
Go into the directory that contains you local git project and use one of the following calls to doctoc:
```bash
doctoc .
doctoc <PathFilename>.md [ <PathFilename2>.md]... 
```

This will update all markdown files in the current directory and all its subdirectories with a table of content that will point at the anchors generated by the markdown parser. Doctoc defaults to using the GitHub parser, but other modes can be specified.

Include the following in the Markdown file to hold the results:
```
## Table of Contents

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<!-- START doctoc -->
<!-- END doctoc -->

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
```

#### Usage a `git` hook

doctoc can be used as a [pre-commit](http://pre-commit.com) hook by using the
following configuration:

```yaml
repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/thlorenz/doctoc
    rev: ...  # substitute a tagged version
    hooks:
    -   id: doctoc
```

This will run `doctoc` against markdown files when committing to ensure the
TOC stays up-to-date.
