## Terminology  

| Term | Description |  
| ---- | ---- |

| Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) | a design document providing information to the **Python** community, or describing a new feature for Python or its processes or environment; kinds of PEP: <br> - A Standards Track PEP describes a new feature or implementation for Python. It may also describe an interoperability standard that will be supported outside the standard library for current Python versions before a subsequent PEP adds standard library support in a future version. <br> - An Informational PEP describes a Python design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the Python community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational PEPs do not necessarily represent a Python community consensus or recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore Informational PEPs or follow their advice. <br> - A Process PEP describes a process surrounding Python, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process PEPs are like Standards Track PEPs but apply to areas other than the Python language itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to Python's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational PEPs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in Python development. Any meta-PEP is also considered a Process PEP. |   

## Phrases
There is a phrase in French, “esprit d’escalier”, which literally means “stairway wit” and is used to refer to a witty remark a person thinks of too late to use in an encounter—a nod to how we often think of something great to say when we are taking the stairs to leave and it is too late to capitalize on our cleverness.  
English legal terms like “cease and desist” or “null and void” are redundant as a result of their translation from Latin legal terms to French (and onward from there).  
The phrases “no man is an island” and “for whom the bell tolls” are both from the same section in a set of devotions, Meditation XVII, by English metaphysical poet and cleric John Donne.  
In military lingo, a “klick” is shorthand for “kilometer”. Although the exact origin of the term is unknown, it is believed to have originated with Australian soldiers in Vietnam, who would use the gas regulator on their rifles to count off the distances they had hiked. They did so by moving it forward one mark for every 100 meters traveled, then reset it on the 10th interval, which resulted in an audible click for every kilometer hiked.  
American author Samuel Clemens’ pen name, Mark Twain, is actually a river boat term that means measure (mark) two (twain) fathoms deep.  
A pangram is a sentence that contains every character in a given language’s alphabet; the most famous English pangram, due to its prominence in early textbooks and in font samples today, is “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog”.  
The claim that “orange” is the only word in the English language without a rhyme is false. There are hundreds of words without perfect rhymes including: bulb, filmed, ninth, and, rather ironically, poem.  
There are very few words in the English language that have a gender differentiation; the most prominent of them all is blond (a man with gold colored hair) and blonde (a woman with gold colored hair).  
"Voluntold" is exactly what it sounds like, an oxymoron combining volunteer and told. It is something one is asked to do voluntarily, but it has an unspoken understanding that it is not actually optional.  
 
### Ground Rules (from Baseball)
“Alright folks, let’s go over the ground rules…” is how just about every group activity starts out, be it a white water rafting trip or an afternoon playing laser tag. The “ground rules” are the basic rules for behavior, safety, and so on, for the given activity. While the term now means the basic rules, and has been used in that fashion since the 1950s, it was originally a literal term. The ground rules were the explicit rules for specific playing fields, or grounds, as they were called and the first known example of such use dates back to 1890.   
Despite the jump in the mid-20th century to general usage, the term is still in use with baseball fields, and per Major League Baseball regulations, individual stadiums have their own ground rules which are designed to take into account the design of the stadium. For example, one of the ground rules at Wrigley Field, where the Chicago Cubs play, concerns the thick ivy on the outfield fence—if a ball becomes lodged in the ivy, two bases are awarded to the batter and all runners. If the ball falls out of the ivy after striking the fence, it remains in play.
