# Excel Columns & Rows

## Columns & Rows Processes

#### Add or delete columns and rows  

• To add a column immediately to the right of the table, type the column heading, and then press ENTER.  
• To add a row to the bottom of the table, type in the blank row immediately below the last row of the table, and then press ENTER.  
• To add a column inside the table, click a cell immediately to the right of where you want to insert the column, right-click, point to Insert, and then click Table Columns to the left.   
• To add a new row inside the table, click in a cell immediately below where you want to insert the row, right-click, point to Insert, and then click Table Rows Above.
• To delete a column, right-click in the column, point to Delete, and then click Table Columns.   
• To delete a row, right-click in the row, point to Delete, and then click Table Rows.   
   
#### Add More Than One New Row or Column  

You may know the way to add one new row or column, but it really wastes a lot of time if you need to insert more than one of these by repeating this action X number of times. The best way is to drag and select X rows or columns (X is two or more) if you want to add X rows or columns above or left. Right click the highlighted rows or columns and choose Insert from the drop down menu. New rows will be inserted above the row or to the left of the column you first selected.  

#### Autofill a formula down a column

1. Click in the first cell under the column heading.
2. Create your formula, and then press ENTER. The formula will automatically fill in every row in the column. 
  
###### AutoFill  

This is a no brainer, but so easily overlooked. You start typing a series of repetitive things like dates (1/1/14, 1/2/14, 1/3/14, etc.) and you know you're in for a long day. Instead, begin the series and move the cursor on the screen to the lower right part of the last cell—the fill handle. When it turns into a plus sign (+), click and drag down to select all the cells you need to fill. They'll magically fill in the pattern you started. Guess what—it can also go up a column, or left or right on a row as well.  

Even better - you can Auto Fill without much of a pattern. Again, pick a cell or cells, move to the fill handle, click, and drag. You'll get a menu of options. The more data you input at first, the better the Fill Series option will do creating your AutoFill options.

###### Flash Fill  

New in the latest version of Excel is one of its best features. Flash Fill will smartly fill a column based on the pattern of data it sees in the first column (it helps if the top row is a unique header row). For example, if the first column is all phone numbers that are formatted like "2125034111" and you want them to all look like "(212)-503-4111," start typing. By the second cell, Excel should recognize the pattern and display what it thinks you want. Just hit enter to use them. This works with numbers, names, dates, etc. If the second cell doesn't give you an accurate range, type some more—the pattern might be hard to recognize. Then go to the Data tab and click the Flash Fill button. Check out this [Microsoft-provided tutorial](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/video-autofill-VA104072618.aspx).  

#### Move a Row/Column  

To swap values between rows and columns, select an entire row or column, and then hold down Shift before dragging your cursor out to the row or column you want to swap its values with.  

Release the Shift key and the mouse button once you’ve got the cursor positioned over where you want to swap the contents of the cell/row/column to.  

#### Remove Duplicate Rows  

1. Select the range you want to remove duplicate rows. If you want to delete all duplicate rows in the worksheet, just hold down Ctrl + A key to select the entire sheet or click inside a table.  
2. On Data tab, click Remove Duplicates in the Data Tools group.  
[ColRow 01]

3. In the Remove Duplicates dialog box, leave all the checkboxes checked under Columns list box, and if your data contains headers, please check My data has headers option. See screenshot:

#### Set Row Height and Column Width in Excel Using the Keyboard  

[Setting the row height and column width in Excel](https://www.howtogeek.com/270296/how-to-set-row-height-and-column-width-in-excel/) is easy, but if you’d rather use the keyboard to do this, it’s not very intuitive. We’ll show you a couple of different ways to set the row height and column width without using your mouse.  

To begin, use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the cell selection to the row or column you want to change, then press the Alt key to go into shortcut key mode. Press “H” to access the Home tab.

[ColRow 03]	 
[ColRow 04]  

Shortcut keys display for all the commands on the Home menu. Press “O” to open the Format menu in the Cells section.  

To change the row height for the row corresponding to the selected cell, press “H” for Row Height.  

[ColRow 05]	 
[ColRow 06]  
	
Enter a value on the Row height dialog box and press Enter.  

Changing the column width is similar to changing the row height. Press Alt, then H, then O (one key after the other, like we mentioned above) and then press “W” for Column Width.  

[ColRow 07]	 
[ColRow 08]  
	
Enter a value on the Column Width dialog box and press Enter.  

We changed the height for row 2 to 20 and the width for column B to 15, as shown below.  

[ColRow 09]	 
[ColRow 10]  

Another option for changing the row height is to press Shift+Spacebar to select the entire row containing the selected cell. Then, press Shift+F10 to bring up the context menu and press “R” to open the Row Height dialog box. Enter a new row height on the dialog box and press Enter.  

You can do the same thing with the Column Width, except you would press Ctrl+Spacebar to select the entire column and then press “W” to open the Column Width dialog box.  

[ColRow 11]  

If you like using the keyboard rather than the mouse, a lot of the commands on the ribbon have shortcut keys assigned to them. You can [display those shortcut keys in the Screentips](https://www.howtogeek.com/214245/how-to-display-shortcut-keys-in-screentips-in-word-2013/) so you can easily learn what they are and start using them.
