# Excel Referencing

| To Reference | Methods |  
| -- | -- |  
| a cell on the current sheet |\<CellReference> <BR> \<RangeName> <BR> `D2` means relative column + relative row reference. <BR> `$D2` means absolute column + relative row reference. <BR> `$D$2` means absolute column + absolute row reference. |  
| a cell in another sheet within the same workbook|\<SheetName>!\<CellReference> <BR>  \<RangeName> |  
| a cell in another sheet within the different workbook|<WorkBookName>!\<SheetName>!\<CellReference> <BR>  \<RangeName> |  

**Note**: Range Names are unique within a workbook, so worksheet referencing is not required.
