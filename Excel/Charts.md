#### Add a Data Series to a Chart with a Few Mouse Clicks  

You can use your mouse to quickly add a data series to an existing chart. For example, let's say you have a chart that shows sales for January and February. To add the data for March, follow these steps:  

1. Click the existing chart. Excel will highlight the corresponding data series for January and February in the spreadsheet.   
2. Click and drag the lower handle of the selection until the third series is included.   

Excel automatically adds the data for March to the chart. Expanding the existing selection works well when the data you want to chart is in adjacent columns.   

For nonadjacent cells, select the cells that contain the data, and click and drag the selection to the existing chart. Excel automatically adds the selected data series to the chart and a generic name to the legend.   

To add the correct name of the series to the legend, activate the Chart Wizard, and follow the steps to add the new data series.
