## Archives  
If you need more than what Windows offers, we recommend 7-Zip. 7-Zip is a free, open-source, powerful archiving tool for Windows. Its own 7z format is fantastic, but it also supports other popular formats including RAR, ZIP, GZIP, BZIP2, DMG, and ISO. 7-Zip actually has the best compression out of any file archiving program, too. Select its own 7z format and you’ll see smaller files than you would with other archive formats.  
  
## Audio-Video  
  
- [JPEG Standards](https://jpeg.org/jpeg/index.html)   
- [MPEG Standards](https://mpeg.chiariglione.org/standards/mpeg-h/image-file-format)   
- [WebP Formats](https://www.howtogeek.com/325864/how-to-save-googles-webp-images-as-jpeg-or-png/)   
- HEVC [AKA: H.265]    High Efficiency Video Compression format)  
  
**Audio**: WAV, FLAC, and ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec, used by iTunes) are all lossless audio formats. MP3, MP4, and OGG are lossy audio formats. Nowadays, computers will play anything, most audio players (except Apple’s, of course) will do multiple lossy formats, and more and more do FLAC and APE. Apple sticks to MP3, ALAC, and AAC.   
Spotify uses the open-source, unpatented Ogg Vorbis format. Apple Music streams proprietary AAC audio. Both formats provide better sound quality than MP3 at low bitrates. However, the difference is negligible at higher bitrates, and for those who care deeply about archival and preserving audio quality, FLAC is still the king of lossless compression.  
#### Lossless Audio  
- FLAC: Free Lossless Audio Codec, a lossless compression method; a FLAC file for stereo audio at “CD quality” runs roughly 5 MB per minute.  
- ALAC: Apple Lossless Audio Codec, a lossless compression method.  
- APE: Monkey’s Audio, a lossless compression method.  
  
#### Lossy Audio   
- MP3: MPEG 1 Audio Layer 3, the most common lossy audio codec today. An average “CD quality” MP3 runs about 1 MB per minute  
- Vorbis:  A free and open-source lossy format used more often in PC games such as Unreal Tournament 3.  FOSS fans, such as many Linux users, are bound to see plenty of this format.  
- AAC:  Advanced Audio Coding, a standardized format now used with MPEG4 video.  It’s heavily supported because of its compatibility with DRM (e.g. Apple’s FairPlay), its improvements over mp3, and because no license is needed in order to stream or distribute content in this format.  Apple fans will probably have plenty in AAC.  
- WMA:  Windows Media Audio, Microsoft’s lossy audio format.  It was developed and used to avoid licensing issues with the MP3 format, but because of major improvements and DRM compatibility, as well as a lossless implementation, it’s still around.  

 
#### Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) Standards
| Standard | Decription |  
| -- | -- |  
|MPEG-1 | Video CD and early digital satellite television|  
|MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 <br> AKA: MP3 | codified in 1993, a lossy method of compressing and playing back audio; 64-128 kbps MP3 files can sound tinny and distorted, high bitrate MP3s sound nearly indistinguishable from uncompressed tracks [Fraunhofer Society]|  
|MPEG-2 | DVDs.|  
|MPEG-3 | never adopted|  
|MPEG-4 | Blu-Rays. Typically use the .mp4 extension.|  

## Images  
Images: RAW, BMP, and PNG are all lossless image formats. JPEG and GIF are lossy image formats.  
- EPS - Encapsulated PostScript file is special type of image file containing a PostScript program. The simplest way to view EPS files is to use EPS Viewer, which is a simple single-function application intended to view EPS files only. When you want to save a file, you can convert it to another more usable format including JPEG, Bitmap, PNG, GIF, and TIFF.
- PNG - Portable Network Graphic is good option for transparency and non-lossy, smaller files. Larger files, not so much, unless you demand non-lossy images.
- GIF - largely a novelty and only useful for animation, but can produce small 8-bit images.
- JPG - still the king for photographs and photo-like images on the internet, but be careful, as your file can degrade with every save.
