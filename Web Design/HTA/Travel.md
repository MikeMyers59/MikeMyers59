### Cahokia Mounds, Mississippi
Just a few miles outside St. Louis are a series of earthen mounds, the last remnants of one of the greatest cities in the world. Settled around the year 600, Cahokia once housed an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 people in six square miles—the city was larger than London in 1250. https://cahokiamounds.org/

### Whispering Firs Stormwater Park
12300 Silverdale Way, north of the Signature Apartments
This stunning new park captures runoff, removes pollutants, and manages storm flows through a series of ponds and treatment cells.  Inside the cells, special soils and native plants remove pollutants like oils, metals, and bacteria from runoff before sending it to holding ponds, which slowly release cleaner water downstream to Clear Creek.  This innovative project is the latest in a series of projects in the Clear Creek watershed designed to reduce flooding, improve water quality, and restore habitat around Clear Creek and Dyes Inlet.
The park is currently open for public use.  Visitors are encouraged to take advantage of the many public amenities surrounding this facility. Walk the paths around the ponds and landscape features, with their concentric ripples reminiscent of the visual rhythms of water drops in a still pool.  Take in the view of the Olympics, picnic amongst the trees, or learn about the many ways this park is working to improve water quality in Puget Sound.
Kitsap County Public Works completed the project in June 2019 with an extensive native planting palette provided by the Kitsap Conservation District. The project was designed by N.L. Olson and Associates and Parametrix; and funded by Kitsap County Public Works – Stormwater in partnership with the Department of Ecology who provided $1.5 million in funding towards the $2.5 million project.
