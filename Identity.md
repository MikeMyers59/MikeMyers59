# Identity Theft

## Freeze Your Credit 

### File With All 3 Credit Bureaus
You'll need to file a credit freeze request with all three major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, for your freeze to actually work. Be prepared to answer questions about your identity before contacting them.

### Have Important Documents on Hand
You will be asked to provide key documents to verify your identity when you initiate a credit freeze, including: Social Security number, photo ID and proof of residence (either a rental agreement, utility bill or some other document with your address on it). Be sure to have these on hand and easy to access.

### Save PINS/Passwords
Each credit agency may assign you a PIN or password to access your account, which you'll also need when you're ready to lift the freeze, according to Kiplinger. Don't try to rely upon your memory for these -- put them somewhere safe and secure.

### Adjust Your Expectations
The most important reason to set up a credit freeze is to prevent credit fraud in your name -- which is when someone opens a credit account in your name without your permission, according to Experian. Yet a freeze is not a foolproof method to prevent fraud. You can still be a victim of identity theft. Examples include: someone using your credit card number to make unauthorized purchases, or someone stealing your Social Security number to file fraudulent tax returns or health insurance claims.

### Set Up Fraud Alerts
If you simply fear that someone might initiate fraud against you, but it hasn't happened yet, you don't need to freeze your credit -- setting up fraud alerts will most likely be effective enough, according to the Federal Trade Commission. And this is a good idea regardless of whether you have already experienced fraud.
