## Freeze Your Credit 

### File With All 3 Credit Bureaus
You'll need to file a credit freeze request with all three major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, for your freeze to actually work. Be prepared to answer questions about your identity before contacting them.

### Have Important Documents on Hand
You will be asked to provide key documents to verify your identity when you initiate a credit freeze, including: Social Security number, photo ID and proof of residence (either a rental agreement, utility bill or some other document with your address on it). Be sure to have these on hand and easy to access.

### Save PINS/Passwords
Each credit agency may assign you a PIN or password to access your account, which you'll also need when you're ready to lift the freeze, according to Kiplinger. Don't try to rely upon your memory for these -- put them somewhere safe and secure.

### Adjust Your Expectations
The most important reason to set up a credit freeze is to prevent credit fraud in your name -- which is when someone opens a credit account in your name without your permission, according to Experian. Yet a freeze is not a foolproof method to prevent fraud. You can still be a victim of identity theft. Examples include: someone using your credit card number to make unauthorized purchases, or someone stealing your Social Security number to file fraudulent tax returns or health insurance claims.

### Set Up Fraud Alerts
If you simply fear that someone might initiate fraud against you, but it hasn't happened yet, you don't need to freeze your credit -- setting up fraud alerts will most likely be effective enough, according to the Federal Trade Commission. And this is a good idea regardless of whether you have already experienced fraud.

## Identify eMail Scams

Indicators that an email, text message, or website is fake:  
1.	When hovering a mouse over a link, the destination web address does not match the web address a user intends to visit.
2.	An email, text message, website, or phone call has an unusual or urgent request for information.
3.	The images are blurry, altered, or slightly different colors than the legitimate versions.
4.	Misspelled words, grammar issues, or a slight change in the language used, compared to the legitimate version of the website.
5.	The web page or email does not display important company information, such as company contact information.
6.	A deal that seems too good to be true

## Phone & Tablet App Precautions

Below are precautions that personnel can take to help safeguard sensitive information while using a mobile device:
- Read the "terms and conditions" associated with each app
- Research the background information of apps and companies who develop them
- Only download apps from trusted sources
- Only allow permissions that are necessary for each app.  For example, a photo editing app should not require access to a user's GPS location
- Only download apps that are necessary and delete apps that are no longer needed
- Limit the amount of personal and financial data that is stored on apps
- Read app reviews prior to downloading
- Use different username and password combinations for different online services and apps, and change the passwords often
